# Purpose of this extension

**This extension is meant for demo and training purposes.**

The extension implements different scenarios with bad-performing AL Code. Some examples:
 - Long-running queries
 - Running substantial code in OnAfterGetRecord
 - Listening for too many database triggers

You can run these scenarios and use the standard troubleshooting tools to identify the root cause.


In addition to getting some hands-on experience with these tools, the examples also make it easy to _demonstrate_ to others how the tools work.

# Installing the extension

Build the extension (e.g. against your Business Central Online sandbox environment).

Then upload the extension (either in the Extension Management page, or publish directly from VS Code).

# Running the scenarios

Open page 50100, and it will explain how to run the scenarios.
